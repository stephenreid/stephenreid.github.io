          <h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
Hi, my name is Stephen. I've been coding and teaching others to code since about 7th grade (in TI Basic in a math class). Since then, the internet has really taken off, so I've focused on web application development. My work history is pretty diverse, with everything including C, Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript.

<h3>Hackathons and Random Hacks of Kindness</h3>

<p> I've really enjoyed playing around with applications and meeting people at Atlanta Hackathons (which really took off). They're a great way to learn about new technologies, write some code, and enjoy thinking about great ideas. As the API Evangelist at Pardot, I actually helped Georgia Tech Young Entrepreneur's Society pull off some and advised some to how to use Pardot.</p>

<p> Random Hacks of Kindness and now Gov/City Hack have been great ways to encourage involvement with the city of Atlanta. At my first one, we worked with mesh networking and eventual consistency on the iPhone / Bluetooth stack with a project that we call MessageCarrier. At my second RHOK, we helped somebody from the CDC help track polio outbreaks.</p>
